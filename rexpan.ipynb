      "What you have to know is, there's a guy who has a website where he blogs his experience doing the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. And many people have come to see this website as THE place to go, whether you need the current day's answers, or compare your solving experience to this guy's, or want to discuss the puzzle in the comments section with other like-minded souls.\n",

      "A little nerdy, perhaps, but not too crazy. But here's the twist: after years of keeping up this blog, this guy (who writes under the pseudonym Rex Parker) has come to pretty much hate these puzzles. So day after day, he will just throw down these preposterous, nitpicky, vendetta-inspired screeds lambasting Will Shortz (the editor of the New York Times puzzle), the constructor, and various clues and answers.\n",
